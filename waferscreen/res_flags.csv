11,13,15,collision,The resonator required several upgrades to the proceeding code. It seems to be a double resonator| where one resonator is connected to the flux ramp and one resonator (or resonate feature) is static as the flux ramp is sweeped.,80,scan5.600GHz-6.100GHz_2021-02-11 19-12-14.079197,chw3k5
